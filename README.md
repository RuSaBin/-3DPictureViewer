Key Design Features

- The design follows Model – View – Controller architecture, which allows to
separate logic and functioning of the model from user interface.
- Model consists of World, Location, Item and Direction classes.
- The main class of the model is World. It is responsible for creating instances
of the Location and Item, keeps track of collected items. World is the only
class of the model, that communicates with WorldController.
- Direction is an enumerated class with four possible directions: NORTH,
SOUTH, EAST and WEST. This class allows to keep all the logic of navigation
defined in one place making it less prone to mistakes and confusion.
Enumerated directions help to ensure internal consistency.
- Location is the class representing locations of the application. It has
collections of neighbouring Locations(coupled with Directions) and Items
present in the Location.
- Item is a class is used by Location class and World class to keep track of the
items, that are put or picked from the Location.
- JavaFX features are used only in the WorldController class, so it can be
easily replaced by any other graphical interface.
- The View class in the diagram, is not a java Class, because in the project
“view” is defined in the fxml file generated by SceneBuilder. Styling is
added by custom made css stylesheet. User interface is created to support
easy navigation by displaying text message and activating “forward”
button, if moving to the next Location is possible.
